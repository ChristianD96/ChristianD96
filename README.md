Although I am still attending school, I have an extensive background thanks to my time in the Air Force. 
I have worked as an orbital analyst working alongside NASA, SpaceX, MIT and other exciting people. 
I worked as a machinist within an agile team creating parts for some of those same companies mentioned above as well as the military. 
I dipped my toes in electrical, took a year worth of mechanical engineering and found myself here awaiting my next adventure!

My point is, I may not have an extensive list of software development accomplishments, but I will within months of my first software career.
